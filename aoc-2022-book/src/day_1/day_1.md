# Day 1: Calorie Counting

Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of [magical energy](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/25) to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of __star__ fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of __fifty stars__ by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants __one star__. Good luck!

The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of __Calories__ each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).
